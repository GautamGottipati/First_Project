# First_Project
Name of the project: Collector Bot</br>
Technologies Used:</br>
 1)Embedded C</br>
 2)Python 2.7</br>
 3)Image Processing through Open-CV python</br>
 4)V-REP (simulating platform)</br>
This is my first project which is done as a part of competition organised by IIT Bombay named as E-Yantra.I feel thankful to be the part of competion. </br>
# GOAL
The goal of the project is to make the vehicle move autonomously and pick up the fresh fruits and leaving damaged fruits, with the help of information provided by overhead camera. Once the fruit is picked it needs to place it in a truck moving around the field 
This vehicle has no sensors inbuilt. A communication is between the camera-> laptop and microcontroller using XIGbee.<br>
